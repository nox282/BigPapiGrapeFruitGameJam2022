# Dogtor - Fake it 'till you make it
## Elevator pitch
You're playing a dog that's a generalist doctor. You get patients that visit your office, they describe
actual symptoms and serious illness, and you can prescribe them with dog treats, toys and belly rubs. Fake it 'till you make it!

## Gameplay
During a day (hard time limit in real seconds): 
1. Patient comes in the Dogtor room
    * small dialog
2. You have a book that relates human actual symptoms to dog treats
    * you can ask questions
    * you choose what to prescribe
    * you have dognostic tools
    * you can auscultate the patient
3. At the end of the day you receive feedback on your treatments
    * If you fail enough patients, you end up in a game over state and get the bad ending.
4. Each day is a level. Each day you get new and more complicated rules and mechanics.

## Graphics
* Full 2D
* Mix of real life photos + light pixel art
* We never see dog apart from its paws when you're auscultating
* Portrait of papi on the wall
